# python dependecy analyser
I need a enterprise grade tool that can analyze python dependencies and transitive dependencies of a python package. It should also be able to display all CVE's related to the dependencies. The tool should be able to take a parameter that specifies a python package. It should also have a help section.
Think about additional usefull features.
